First things first: a bit about my self:

I’m a builder, its deep in my blood.

My Father was a jeweler and MaE (my mother) still is an excellent cook and a superb “tejedora” (craft weaver). So I started playing at the jewelry’s shop at a very young age.  having a guidance in the fine finishing of the metals is been the foundation of my skill set. 

I love drawing always have. Devoted my self to painting was always “The Dream” but it didn’t feel just right until 2016 (at 47 years old) that the “call” stroke me :)

I had a very productive start then COVID came.

By early 2021 I was working on a “digitalPainting” collection when the storm of NFTs got loose. Finally a way to fight copy/paste in the world of computer art !!! 

At this point I’m totally hooked in Block Chain. I keep doing my research and working on a couple of projects that I hope help us to spread the love for art.
